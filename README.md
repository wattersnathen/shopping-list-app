# Shopping List

### Description
Keep track of all the items you need to purchase or have already purchased as well as the quantity of each item.

### Purpose
This project was initially designed as a small app to learn how to manipulate the DOM by adding and deleting items using
JavaScript/jQuery. From that grew the opportunity to learn two new things: one - how to use jQuery-UI to enable drag and 
drop functionality between two sets of lists, and two - to save the state of the list(s) using the localStorage API.

### How to use
<em>To Start:</em>
1. Type in an item where it says 'enter item here...' followed by the quantity (default & minimum is 1).
2. Either click the button that says '+Add' or hit the Return key
3. Watch as the item is appended to the 'Items' list
4. Add as many items as you'd like

<em>Add items to 'Purchased' list</em>
- Click the checkbox on any one item within the 'Items' list. 
- Move your mouse over an item until you see your cursor change. Then click and drag to the other list.

<em>Update the item and/or quantity</em>
1. On the item you wish to change, click the 'Edit' button.
2. Edit the item and/or the quantity.
3. Click the 'Edit' button once again.

<em>Remove an item from either list</em>
1. Click the 'Delete' button

<em>Remove all items from both lists</em>
1. Click the 'Clear List(s)' button

<em>Save the current state of both lists</em>
1. Click the 'Save List(s)' button. 
Refresh the page to see that your list states did actually save.
