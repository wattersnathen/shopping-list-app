# Shopping List

### Description
Keep track of all the items you need to purchase or have already purchased as well as the quantity of each item.

### Purpose
This project was initially designed as a small app to learn how to manipulate the DOM by adding and deleting items using
JavaScript/jQuery. From that grew the opportunity to learn two new things: one - how to use jQuery-UI to enable drag and 
drop functionality between two sets of lists, and two - to save the state of the list(s) using the localStorage API.

### How to use
<p>To Start:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type in an item where it says 'enter item here...' followed by the quantity (default & minimum is 1).</li>
  <li>Either click the button that says '+Add' or hit the Return key</li>
  <li>Watch as the item is appended to the 'Items' list</li>
  <li>Add as many items as you'd like</li>
</ol>

<p>Add items to 'Purchased' list</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the checkbox on any one item within the 'Items' list. </li>
  <li>Move your mouse over an item until you see your cursor change. Then click and drag to the other list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Update the item and/or quantity</p>
<ol>
  <li>On the item you wish to change, click the 'Edit' button.</li>
  <li>Edit the item and/or the quantity.</li>
  <li>Click the 'Edit' button once again.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remove an item from either list</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the 'Delete' button</li>
</ol>

<p>Remove all items from both lists</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the 'Clear List(s)' button</li>
</ol>

<p>Save the current state of both lists</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the 'Save List(s)' button.</li>
</ol>
